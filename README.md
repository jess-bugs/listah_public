# LISTAH! PUBLIC

This public repository represents the very last commit I made on project Listah before I decided to make it public. The emphasis on public is given for a reasonâ€”a private repository for this project is separate, and it is to be decided if I'll keep this public repo updated to the private one.

The purpose is for the employers to assess my base knowledge of how I code, plan, organize, and assess my projects.
